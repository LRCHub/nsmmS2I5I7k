# Wuthering Waves、Gokou、Surya – Into Falling Snow

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Flaking snow
Silence grows
Giant steps paving the way
Ancient footprints sleep in longest night
Expecting discovery
Breathing cold
Pulsing close
Storms are pushing us to go
Reaching down below
Dive deep into the space
Across the stars riding away
To all the places where we've never been
That's our curiosity
Linger on
Wishing for the better days
Bring the dawn
Satellites
Quiet core
Resonance's hard to find
Meteors crash toward frozen crust
That can't crush crave for the unknown
Engine falls
Frosted dreams
Heated hearts won't give it up
On this endless road
Dive deep into the space
Across the stars riding away
To all the places where we've never been
That's our curiosity
Linger on
Wishing for the better days
Bring the dawn
Into the snow (Into the snow, into the snow)
Into the snow
